  Here’s my real bio.\n\nI’m a self-taught software engineer who’s still
  working to become better each day. Complex projects excite me specially those
  that would squeeze out my creativity. I love solving problems but as much as
  possible, I want to make sure that the solutions I bring are clean, scalable,
  and well designed.\n\nI graduated with electronics engineering degree but I
  guess I just love creating software products. I still save up for my ambitious
  electronics projects though. \n\nI currently develop apps with React and
  NodeJS (AWS Lambda).
